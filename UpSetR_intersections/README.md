## UpSetR

UpSetR is an R package used for visualizing and analyzing sets, intersections, and their properties.

The main purpose of UpSetR is to create interactive plots known as UpSet plots, 
which allow you to visualize the intersections and overlaps between multiple sets or groups.
These sets can represent different categories or attributes,
and the intersections between them can reveal common elements or relationships.

To run this package, you have to have a matrix that contains binary vaules. This means that each cell in the matrix must contain either a 1 if the
element is present in the corresponding set or a 0 if it is absent. 

Here is an example of the type of file needed for input:

The **UpSetR_script.Rmd** contains a few examples of how to use the package.
