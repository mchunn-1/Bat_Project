# De Novo Assembly and Analysis of Bat Tongue Transcriptomes 

This repository contains information on de novo transcriptome assembly using the Oyster River Protocol (ORP) and subsequent approaches taken for analysis (KEGG, differenetial expression, orthogroup detection). 

Information on using the ORP can be found in the folder titled "ORP".

Following assembly using ORP, transcriptomes can be submitted to [KEGG automatic annoation server](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/) for fast K number assignment. K number assigned transcripts can then be submitted to [KEGG mapper](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper/)for imidiate pathway comparison.
