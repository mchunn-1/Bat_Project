# De Novo Assembly and Analysis of Bat Tongue Transcriptomes 

This repository contains information on de novo transcriptome assembly using the Oyster River Protocol (ORP) and subsequent approaches taken for analysis.

Following assembly using ORP, transcriptomes can be submitted to [KEGG automatic annotation server](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/) for fast K number assignment. K number assigned transcripts can then be submitted to [KEGG mapper](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper/) for immediate pathway comparison. 

Details on steps taken for other analysis can be found in the respective folders.
